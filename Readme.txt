# UNFINISHED PROJECT

I followed a tutorial project about Unity Engine from a **Bardent** YT channel. You can find the whole playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy78FINcVmjA0zDBhLuLNL1Jo6xNMMq-W)

It involves mainly 2D character movement, finite state machine and basic enemy behaviour. Later it also shows how to create complex weapon system. 
It has links for premade graphic assets in pixelart style, so you don't have to worry about them.
In my opinion it's one of the best Unity tutorials on YT, very straightforward and easy to understand even withoud extensive C# knowledge.
Hopefully I will finish it one day.
